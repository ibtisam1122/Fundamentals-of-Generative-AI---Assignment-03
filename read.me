AI Agents are autonomous software programs designed to perform tasks on behalf of users or other systems by making decisions based on predefined rules, learned patterns, or real-time data analysis. They are often equipped with artificial intelligence capabilities, such as machine learning, natural language processing, and reasoning, which enable them to adapt their behavior in dynamic environments.

Key Characteristics of AI Agents:
Autonomy: AI agents operate independently without continuous human intervention. They can make decisions and take actions to achieve specific goals.

Proactiveness: They can anticipate and act on opportunities or problems before being explicitly instructed to do so. This proactive behavior allows them to be more efficient in task execution.

Reactivity: AI agents can perceive changes in their environment and respond accordingly. This allows them to adjust their behavior in real-time based on the situation.

Social Ability: Many AI agents can interact and collaborate with other agents or humans. This interaction can involve communication, negotiation, or even cooperation in a multi-agent system.

Learning: Advanced AI agents have the ability to learn from their experiences, improving their performance over time. This learning can be based on reinforcement learning, supervised learning, or unsupervised learning techniques.

Examples of AI Agents:
Chatbots: These are AI agents designed to interact with users through text or voice, providing information, answering questions, or assisting with tasks like booking appointments.
Virtual Assistants: AI agents like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa that help users manage their daily activities, control smart home devices, and provide personalized recommendations.
Autonomous Vehicles: AI agents that drive vehicles without human intervention, making decisions based on sensor data, maps, and real-time conditions.
Trading Bots: AI agents in financial markets that execute trades automatically based on market analysis and predefined strategies.
